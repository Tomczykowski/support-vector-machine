# Support Vector Machine
Solving the behavioral cloning problem using SVM (Support Vector Machine)
<br>Using the generated datasets, model implementation, training the model on the data, and testing the model in the game, 
<br>the model, based on the state of the game, returns the action to be performed by the snake.
